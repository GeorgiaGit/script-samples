# Renaming a SharePoint Hub Site URL

## Summary

Renaming a SharePoint Hub Site URL or title is not a straightforward process. A hub site can not be renamed directly. Instead, the hub site needs to be unregistered before performing the rename, and then re-register it as a hub. This ensures the integrity of the hub structure and keeps associated sites intact.

‚úèÔ∏è Renaming the site URL and title
